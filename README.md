## Synopsis

**syncCurrency** is a currency exchange door originally designed for running under [Synchronet BBS Software](http://www.synchro.net).  It will display the current
exchange rates for $1.00USD in various currencies.  It uses data from the Free API at [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org).  It was originally written by Robert Stinnett aka dmxrob of [Gateway to the West BBS - bbs.dmxrob.net](telnet://bbs.dmxrob.net) as a way to get back into BBSing and learn more about Synchronet and Javascript.
