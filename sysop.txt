I) Getting a Open Exchange Rates API Key

You can get your free API key for Open Exchange Rates here: https://openexchangerates.org/signup/free

Free API plans are limited to 1,000 calls per month.  This shouldn't be a problem for most systems.  
Future versions may include a way to cache/rate-limit to help keep below 1,000 calls/month.

Once you sign up, after verifying your email address, you should get your key immediately.

--------------------

II) External Program Configuration

Setting up the syncCurrency App (currency.js):

1: If you downloaded this as a ZIP file, extract the files to a folder in your /sbbs/xtrn/ directory. This doc assumes you named the
   folder "syncCurrency" (ie. /sbbs/xtrn/syncCurrency/). 

2: Add the following section to your ctrl/modopts.ini file (typically located at /sbbs/ctrl/modopts.ini):

[synCurrency]
openExchangeAPIkey = <your API key here>
currencyTypes = MXN|CAD|EUR|GBP


Change the entry for "openExchangeAPIkey = <your API key here>" by adding your API Key from Section I. 
	Example:
	openExchangeAPIkey = 123456789abc1234


Change the currencyTypes to display whatever currency you wish.  The list can be as long as you want.  Seperate each entry with a | bar character as shown above.
In the example shown above we are getting Mexican Pesos, Canadian Dollars, Euros and British Pounds.

For a list of valid currency types in a web browser simple paste the following url replacing <your API key here> with your Open Exchange Rates API key:
https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json?app_id=<Your API Key Here>


NOTE: No quotes are needed in the modopts.ini section you added.
